    <p><span class="firstcharacter">D</span>r. Hillary Cash takes away her patients' phones. No more internet. No more video games. Only counselling and exercise can ready her internet addicts for a world of technology.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      "Young adults in their twenties or teens, by the time they get to us, they have lost control," said Dr. Hillary Cash, co-founder and Chief Clinical Officer of reSTART Life, a residential center for problematic use of internet, gaming and virtual reality.
  </p>
  </div>

<div>
  <p>The psychologist, sociologist and technology community are debating if a person can be "addicted" to the internet. The term, critics argue, is overly attributed to compulsive habits.
  </p>
<div>

  <div>
    <p>
     The internet addiction prospect is slowly gaining acceptance in U.S. and international health circles. Critics say internet addiction is an alarmist myth enticing moral and technological panic. Others say there aren't enough studies supporting its existence, argueing that just because users form habits around their phones doesn't mean they are addicted. Despite its controversy, psychiatrists are already treating "Internet Gaming Disorder" in detox retreats.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
"It's becoming irrefutable," said Dr. Cash. "Unlike other addictions, you can carry your addictive device, the thing which you can carry around with you 24/7."
</p>
</div>


  <div>
    <p>
  Dr. Cash's patients usually stay eight weeks at the retreat where they are detox, regularly exercise, catch up on sleep and receive counseling. Part of that counseling is helping patients understand what propels their addiction and catching up on social skills and regulating emotions.
  </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      "Our goal at the end of that eight week period," said Dr. Cash, "is to get them to move on and function well as young adult men."
    </p>
    </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      In 2013, The American Psychiatric Association added "Internet Gaming Disorder" to the DSM-5, a guide to disorders and diagnosis, stating while it's not a "formal" disorder, it's a "new phenomenon" that warrants further study.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      The World Health Organization is adding "Gaming Disorder" to its newest revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) in Mid-2018.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      The draft ICD-11 code criteria is time-based and is less defined than the DSM-5: "For gaming disorder to be diagnosed, the behaviour pattern must be of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and would normally have been evident for at least 12 months."
    </p>
    </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      Some scholars have said that while individuals may have a clear compulsive habit that does hinder aspects of their lives, internet itself is not the problem.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      While there is no clear consensus for diagnosing "internet use disorder" or "gaming use disorder," the DSM-5 states nine criteria closely associated with use disorders that may help define it.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>These flippable cards identify the nine DSM-5 criteria in Dr. Cash's patients she treats:
    </p>
  </div>

<!-- NEW CODE -->
<h4>Criteria 1-9</h4>
        <div id="card1" class="pointer">
  <div class="front">
    <span class="firstcharacter2">1.</span> The individual thinks about previous gaming activity or anticipates playing the next game; gaming becomes the dominant activity in daily life;
  </div>
  <div class="back">
    "These guys are typically sleep deprived. They are severely out of shape," said Dr. Cash. "They've been living off pizza and soda. They haven’t been showering and their living spaces are are pigsties."
  </div>
</div>

  <div id="card2" class="pointer">
    <div class="front">
<span class="firstcharacter2">2.</span> Withdrawal symptoms when gaming is taken away: These symptoms are typically described as irritability, anxiety, or sadness;
    </div>
      <div class="back">
When "addicts" stay at the retreat center, they are cut off from all mobile device use. During that time, Dr. Cash explained, they experience withdrawal symptoms, restless sleep and depression.
      </div>
  </div>

<div id="card3" class="pointer">
  <div class="front">
<span class="firstcharacter2">3.</span> Tolerance: The need to spend increasing amounts of time engaged in games;
</div>
    <div class="back">
Many of Dr. Cash's patients experience "tolerance." As the patient’s brain regulates itself and manages its overstimulation by gaming, the patient needs more gaming to satisfy their craving.
    </div>
  </div>

<div id="card4" class="pointer">
  <div class="front">
<span class="firstcharacter2">4.</span> Unsuccessful attempts to control or reduce participation in games;
  </div>
  <div class="back">
The young adults in their teens or twenties at the retreat have "lost control" by the time they are admitted to the reSTART retreat in Fall City, Washington, according to Dr. Cash. They are bright young men, she said, but are unsuccessful because of their compulsion to play video games.
  </div>
</div>

<div id="card5" class="pointer">
<div class="front">
<span class="firstcharacter2">5.</span> Loss of interest in real-life relationships, previous hobbies, and other entertainment as a result of, and with the exception of, games;
</div>
<div class="back">
Many admitted to reSTART Life retreat were introduced to gaming or the internet at a young age. "It really impacts their childhood," said Dr. Cash. "It makes them socially anxious, their social skills are not well developed."
</div>
</div>

<div id="card6" class="pointer">
<div class="front">
<span class="firstcharacter2">6.</span> Continued excessive use of games despite knowledge of psychosocial problems;
</div>
<div class="back">
"Their life skills, navigating the world, the social world the work world is not well advanced," said Dr. Cash. "So by the time they get to us, they are usually depressed and are really lacking in a lot of skills."
</div>
</div>

<div id="card7" class="pointer">
<div class="front">
<span class="firstcharacter2">7.</span> Has deceived family members, therapists, or others regarding the amount of gaming;
</div>
<div class="back">
"The need to satisfy the craving leads them, all addicts, to behaviors that lead them against behaviors to what they know is right," said Dr. Cash. "They may steal their parents credit card to indulge in their addiction."
</div>
</div>

<div id="card8" class="pointer">
<div class="front">
<span class="firstcharacter2">8.</span> Use of games to escape or relieve a negative mood (eg, feelings of helplessness, guilt, or anxiety);
</div>
<div class="back">
"They escape boredom, anxiety and loneliness," said Dr. Cash. "For an addict, I don't care what your addiction is, it's a way of medicating pain and discomfort."
</div>
</div>

<div id="card9" class="pointer">
<div class="front">
<span class="firstcharacter2">9.</span> Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of participation in games.
</div>
<div class="back">
Many of Dr. Cash's patient's are young adults "They might rationally know I need to to study for thesis exam," said Dr. Cash, "but they lose all sense of time and they make the choice to indulge in the addictive craving."
</div>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
(Like any disorder, internet and gaming use disorder can only be properly diagnosed by an licensed psychiatrist. These are criteria are still up for scholarly and medical research and discussion.)
